            <h4>PacMan Project</h4>
            <p>In this project, there are two buttons on the page. One button (“Add PacMan”) allows you to add a new PacMan that appears at a random position on the screen. The other button (“Start Game”) causes each PacMan to begin moving at a random velocity. A PacMan can still be added even after the game has been started. When a PacMen hits the edge of a screen, it changes positions so it can stay in the page’s frame.</p>

            <h4>Eye Movement Project</h4>
            <p>This project creates a webpage with two eyes that follows the movement of your mouse. The eyes are synchronized so they move in the same direction to match the mouse. In this project, the mouse movement event is used to update the position of the ‘eye’ element through manipulating the DOM.</p>

            <h4>Real Time Bus Tracker Project</h4>
            <p>This project utilizes the mapboxgl JavaScript library which allows you to add customizations to the map. Utilizing the MBTA bus data, stops between Harvard and MIT are determined. Once these are known, an animated market on the map highlights the bus routes.</p>
